A simple Black Jack game done with C#. Currently it's Player versus Dealer and done without methods. There is also no betting at this current time. (Still learning.) 
Update 7/24/2024 Uploaded code called Black Jack Redux. I am reorganzing the code using methods since I learned it. Right now it's only just single player and is a work in progress.
